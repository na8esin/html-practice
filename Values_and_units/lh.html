  Summer is a time for adventure, and this year was no exception. I had many
  exciting experiences, but two of my favorites were my trip to the beach and my
  week at summer camp.

<p style="line-height: 4em">
  At the beach, I spent my days swimming, collecting shells, and building
  sandcastles. I also went on a boat ride and saw dolphins swimming alongside
  us.
